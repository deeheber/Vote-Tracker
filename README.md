# Vote-Tracker
This is an app that allows users to vote on their preferred item, stores the vote, and displays the totals in a graph using the canvasJS library.

Future Improvements:
1. Unchecked boxes dissappear when rearranging the checkboxes.
2. When hiding an item, there's still an open space where it used to be (need to find a way to save the x values in the priorItemsHidden array while change the x values in the colorData array).
