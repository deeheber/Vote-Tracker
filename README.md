# Vote-Tracker
This is an app that allows users to vote on their preferred item, stores the vote, and displays the totals in a graph using the canvasJS library.

Future Improvements:
1. Unchecked boxes dissappear when rearranging the checkboxes. --> Need to find a way to feed the priorItemsHidden array items into the colorData array prior to drag & drop.
2. Need to update the master array order during drag and drop.
