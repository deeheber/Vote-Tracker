# Vote-Tracker
This is an app that allows users to vote on their preferred item, stores the vote, and displays the totals in a graph using the canvasJS library.

Questions/Things to Fix:
1. Why is the height of my #chartContainer section's height 0?
2. Change the colors of the chart bars to match the color voted for.
3. Remove inline onClick events and replace with Event Listeners.
