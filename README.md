# Vote-Tracker
This is an app that allows users to vote on their preferred item, stores the vote, and displays the totals in a graph using the canvasJS library.

Questions:
1. Randomly getting uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'image' of undefined.
2. Why is the height of my #chartContainer section's height 0?
